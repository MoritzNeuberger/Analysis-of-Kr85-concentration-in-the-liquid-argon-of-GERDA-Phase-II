	abstract = {The DarkSide-50 direct-detection dark matter experiment is a dual-phase argon time projection chamber operating at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This paper reports on the blind analysis and spin-independent dark matter-nucleon coupling results from a 532.4 live-days exposure, using a target of low-radioactivity argon extracted from underground sources. The background-free result in the dark matter selection box gave no evidence for dark matter. The present blind analysis sets a 90\% C.L. upper limit on the dark matter-nucleon spin-independent cross section of 1.1E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2 (3.8E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2, 3.4E-43 cm{\textasciicircum}2) for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c{\textasciicircum}2 (1 TeV/c{\textasciicircum}2, 10 TeV/c{\textasciicircum}2).},

The sensitivity strongly relies on the absence of background around the Q-value of the decay. Background coming from 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K, a progeny of 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}Ar, can contribute to that background via electrons from the continuous spectrum with an endpoint at 3.5 MeV. Research and development on the suppression methods targeting this source of background were performed at the low-background test facility LArGe . It was demonstrated that by reducing 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K ion collection on the surfaces of the broad energy germanium detectors in combination with pulse shape discrimination techniques and an argon scintillation veto, it is possible to suppress 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K background by three orders of magnitude.

The upgrade of the Gerda experiment from Phase I to Phase II has been concluded in December 2015.

Gerda is thus the first experiment that will remain “background-free” up to its design exposure (100 kg year{\textbackslash}hbox \{100 kg\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}hbox \{year\}). It will reach thereby a half-life sensitivity of more than 102610{\textasciicircum}\{26\} year within 3 years of data collection.

Low radioactivity argon is of general interest, in particular for the construction of large scale WIMP dark matter searches and detectors of reactor neutrinos for non-proliferation efforts. Atmospheric argon has an activity of about 1 Bq/kg from the decays of 39Ar; the concentration of 39Ar in the underground argon we are collecting is at least a factor of 100 lower than this value. The argon is collected from a stream of gas from a CO2 well in southwestern Colorado with a Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption (VPSA) plant. The gas from the well contains argon at a concentration of 400-600 ppm, and the VPSA plant produces an output stream with an argon concentration at the level of 30,000-50,000 ppm (3-5\%) in a single pass. This gas is sent for further processing to Fermilab where it is purified by cryogenic distillation. The argon production rate is presently 0.5 kg/day.},

	abstract = {Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in our Universe by neutrinos being their own antiparticles. This would imply the existence of neutrinoless double-β decay, which is an extremely rare lepton-number-violating radioactive decay process whose detection requires the utmost background suppression. Among the programmes that aim to detect this decay, the GERDA Collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double-β decay of 76Ge by operating bare detectors, made of germanium with an enriched 76Ge fraction, in liquid argon. After having completed Phase I of data taking, we have recently launched Phase II. Here we report that in GERDA Phase II we have achieved a background level of approximately 10−3 counts keV−1 kg−1 yr−1. This implies that the experiment is background-free, even when increasing the exposure up to design level. This is achieved by use of an active veto system, superior germanium detector energy resolution and improved background recognition of our new detectors. No signal of neutrinoless double-β decay was found when Phase I and Phase II data were combined, and we deduce a lower-limit half-life of 5.3 × 1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level. Our half-life sensitivity of 4.0 × 1025 years is competitive with the best experiments that use a substantially larger isotope mass. The potential of an essentially background-free search for neutrinoless double-β decay will facilitate a larger germanium experiment with sensitivity levels that will bring us closer to clarifying whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles.},

	abstract = {We evaluate the Schechter-Valle (Black Box) theorem quantitatively by considering the most general Lorentz invariant Lagrangian consisting of point-like operators for neutrinoless double beta decay. It is well known that the Black Box operators induce Majorana neutrino masses at four-loop level. This warrants the statement that an observation of neutrinoless double beta decay guarantees the Majorana nature of neutrinos. We calculate these radiatively generated masses and find that they are many orders of magnitude smaller than the observed neutrino masses and splittings. Thus, some lepton number violating New Physics (which may at tree-level not be related to neutrino masses) may induce Black Box operators which can explain an observed rate of neutrinoless double beta decay. Although these operators guarantee finite Majorana neutrino masses, the smallness of the Black Box contributions implies that other neutrino mass terms (Dirac or Majorana) must exist. If neutrino masses have a significant Majorana contribution then this will become the dominant part of the Black Box operator. However, neutrinos might also be predominantly Dirac particles, while other lepton number violating New Physics dominates neutrinoless double beta decay. Translating an observed rate of neutrinoless double beta decay into neutrino masses would then be completely misleading. Although the principal statement of the Schechter-Valle theorem remains valid, we conclude that the Black Box diagram itself generates radiatively only mass terms which are many orders of magnitude too small to explain neutrino masses. Therefore, other operators must give the leading contributions to neutrino masses, which could be of Dirac or Majorana nature.},

The signature of the signal is a monoenergetic peak at 2039 keV, the QββQββQ\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} value of the decay. To avoid bias in the signal search, the present analysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 keV wide region centered around QββQββQ\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \}. The main parameters needed for the 0νββ0νββ0{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe the observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that are expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the observation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model predicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around QββQββQ\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} with a background index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8 ××{\textbackslash}times 10−310−310{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} cts/(keV kg yr). A part of the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of the background model are consistent. The observed number of events in this energy region is consistent with the background model. The background at QββQββQ\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} is dominated by close sources, mainly due to 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K, 214214{\textasciicircum}\{214\}Bi, 228228{\textasciicircum}\{228\}Th, 6060{\textasciicircum}\{60\}Co and αα{\textbackslash}alpha emitting isotopes from the 226226{\textasciicircum}\{226\}Ra decay chain. The individual fractions depend on the assumed locations of the contaminants. It is shown, that after removal of the known γγ{\textbackslash}gamma peaks, the energy spectrum can be fitted in an energy range of 200 keV around QββQββQ\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} with a constant background. This gives a background index consistent with the full model and uncertainties of the same size.},

Germanium detectors made of material with an enriched 7676{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge fraction act simultaneously as sources and detectors for this decay.

A subgroup of these detectors has already been deployed in Gerda during Phase I. The present paper reviews the complete production chain of these BEGe detectors including isotopic enrichment, purification, crystal growth and diode production. The efforts in optimizing the mass yield and in minimizing the exposure of the 7676{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge enriched germanium to cosmic radiation during processing are described. Furthermore, characterization measurements in vacuum cryostats of the first subgroup of seven BEGe detectors and their long-term behavior in liquid argon are discussed.

The framework organizes the data into a multi-level structure, from the raw data up to the condensed analysis parameters, and includes tools and utilities to handle the data stream between the different levels. GELATIO is implemented in C++. It relies upon ROOT and its extension TAM, which provides compatibility with PROOF, enabling the software to run in parallel on clusters of computers or many-core machines. It was tested on different platforms and benchmarked in several GERDA-related applications. A stable version is presently available for the GERDA Collaboration and it is used to provide the reference analysis of the experiment data.},

	abstract = {The Gerda experiment located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of INFN searches for neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay of 76Ge using germanium diodes as source and detector. In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type detectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research for the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched 76Ge fraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse shape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This paper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase I were unblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV γ rays from 208Tl decays as well as two-neutrino double beta (2νββ) decays of 76Ge are used as proxies for 0νββ decay.For BEGe detectors the chosen selection is based on a single pulse shape parameter. It accepts 0.92±0.02 of signal-like events while about 80 \% of the background events at Q ββ =2039 keV are rejected.For semi-coaxial detectors three analyses are developed. The one based on an artificial neural network is used for the search of 0νββ decay. It retains 90 \% of DEP events and rejects about half of the events around Q ββ . The 2νββ events have an efficiency of 0.85±0.02 and the one for 0νββ decays is estimated to be 0.90+0.05−0.090.90−0.09+0.050.90{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.09\}. A second analysis uses a likelihood approach trained on Compton edge events. The third approach uses two pulse shape parameters. The latter two methods confirm the classification of the neural network since about 90 \% of the data events rejected by the neural network are also removed by both of them. In general, the selection efficiency extracted from DEP events agrees well with those determined from Compton edge events or from 2νββ decays.},

	abstract = {Neutrinoless double beta decay, which is a very old and yet elusive process, is reviewed. Its observation will signal that lepton number is not conserved and the neutrinos are Majorana particles. More importantly it is our best hope for determining the absolute neutrino mass scale at the level of a few tens of meV. To achieve the last goal certain hurdles have to be overcome involving particle, nuclear and experimental physics. Nuclear physics is important for extracting the useful information from the data. One must accurately evaluate the relevant nuclear matrix elements, a formidable task. To this end, we review the sophisticated nuclear structure approaches recently been developed, which give confidence that the needed nuclear matrix elements can be reliably calculated. From an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the life times are long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. If a signal is found, it will be a tremendous accomplishment. Then, of course, the real task is going to be the extraction of the neutrino mass from the observations. This is not trivial, since current particle models predict the presence of many mechanisms other than the neutrino mass, which may contribute or even dominate this process. We will, in particular, consider the following processes: (i)The neutrino induced, but neutrino mass independent contribution. (ii)Heavy left and/or right handed neutrino mass contributions. (iii)Intermediate scalars (doubly charged etc). (iv)Supersymmetric (SUSY) contributions. We will show that it is possible to disentangle the various mechanisms and unambiguously extract the important neutrino mass scale, if all the signatures of the reaction are searched in a sufficient number of nuclear isotopes.},

	abstract = {This paper gives the yearly 85Kr emissions of all known reprocessing facilities, which are the main sources of 85Kr in the atmosphere since 1945, for the years 1945 until 2000. According to this inventory 10,600PBq (Peta=1015) of 85Kr have been globally emitted from the year 1945 until the end of 2000. The global atmospheric inventory at the end of the year 2000 amounts to 4800PBq. These emissions have been incorporated into the ECHAM4 atmospheric general circulation model as point sources. Monthly mean model results are compared with measurements made at different locations and times. The influence of each source on the measured concentrations at various locations is studied. The calculated concentrations are found to give reasonably good agreement with the observations, indicating that the emission inventory is realistic. Although, at all northern hemispheric observation sites the model tends to slightly overestimate the concentrations. A possible reason for this overestimation can be found in model features (coarse resolution in time and space). The most prominent discrepancy that is consistently repeated at all northern hemispheric stations occurs in the early 1990s. This could most likely be related to an overestimate of sources. Possibly, the Russian emissions declined earlier than assumed in the current database. Another discrepancy between observations and simulations indicating an incompleteness of the release data is found at some southern hemispheric sites. The variability of their observations could only be explained by regional sources. However, several spikes occur after 1992 when no reprocessing facility is known to be in operation in the southern hemisphere. Production of isotopes for radiopharmaceuticals like technetium-99m from highly enriched uranium is the most likely explanation.},

	abstract = {Krypton-85 is mainly produced in nuclear reactors by fission of uranium and plutonium and released during chopping and dissolution of spent fuel rods in nuclear reprocessing facilities. As noble gas it is suited as a passive tracer for evaluation of atmospheric transport models. Furthermore, research is ongoing to assess its quality as an indicator for clandestine reprocessing activities. This paper continues previous efforts to compile a comprehensive historic emission inventory for krypton-85. Reprocessing facilities are the by far largest emitters of krypton-85. Information on sources and calculations used to derive the annual krypton-85 emission is provided for all known reprocessing facilities in the world. In addition, the emission characteristics of two plants, Tokai (Japan) and La Hague (France), are analysed in detail using emission data with high temporal resolution. Other types of krypton-85 sources are power reactors, naval reactors and isotope production facilities. These sources contribute only little or negligible amounts of krypton-85 compared to the large reprocessing facilities. Taking the decay of krypton-85 into account, the global atmospheric inventory is estimated to about 5500 PBq at the end of 2009. The correctness if the inventory has been proven by meteorological simulations and its error is assumed to be in the range of a few percent.},

The spikes are superimposed on the 85Kr baseline of typically 22 pCim3 (year 1983) which is steadily increasing by a few percent per year. Most of the spikes are the result of discharges of two European reprocessing plants for nuclear fuel, Sellafield and La Hague.

Simulated distributions for the period 1980-1983 are in excellent agreement with data from six latitudinal profiles measured over the Atlantic. High concentrations of 85Kr are predicted over the Arctic in winter, advected from European sources, and somewhat smaller enhancements arising from the same sources are predicted over the tropical Atlantic in summer. Latitudinal gradients are steepest in the northern tropics, with distinctly different seasonal variations over the Pacific, as compared to the Atlantic. The global inventory of 85Kr is reconstructed for the period 1980-1983 by combining the concentrations measured over the Atlantic with the global distributions predicted by the model. The magnitude of the Soviet source is derived. The interhemispheric exchange time is calculated as 1.1 years, with little seasonal dependence.},

By use of dedicated electrostatic filters with high acceptance and resolution, the uncertainty on the observable \$m{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}nu\_e)\$ has been pushed down to about 3 eV\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The new upper limit of the mass is \$m({\textbackslash}nu\_e) {\textless} 2\$ eV at 95\% C.L. In view of erroneous and unphysical mass results obtained by some earlier experiments in beta decay, particular attention is paid to systematic effects. The mass limit is discussed in the context of current neutrino research in particle- and astrophysics. A preview is given of the next generation of beta spectroscopy experiments currently under development and construction; they aim at lowering the \$m{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}nu\_e)\$-uncertainty by another factor of 100, reaching a sensitivity limit \$m({\textbackslash}nu\_e) {\textless} 0.2\$ eV.},

	abstract = {The Standard Model of particle physics cannot explain the dominance of matter over anti-matter in our Universe. In many model extensions this is a very natural consequence of neutrinos being their own anti-particles (Majorana particles) which implies that a lepton number violating radioactive decay named neutrinoless double beta (\$0{\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta\$) decay should exist. The detection of this extremely rare hypothetical process requires utmost suppression of any kind of backgrounds. The GERDA collaboration searches for \$0{\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta\$ decay of \${\textasciicircum}\{76\}\$Ge (\${\textasciicircum}\{76\}{\textbackslash}rm\{Ge\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{76\}{\textbackslash}rm\{Se\} + 2e{\textasciicircum}-\$) by operating bare detectors made from germanium with enriched \${\textasciicircum}\{76\}\$Ge fraction in liquid argon. Here, we report on first data of GERDA Phase II. A background level of \${\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ cts/(keV\${\textbackslash}cdot\$kg\${\textbackslash}cdot\$yr) has been achieved which is the world-best if weighted by the narrow energy-signal region of germanium detectors. Combining Phase I and II data we find no signal and deduce a new lower limit for the half-life of \$5.3{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{25\}\$ yr at 90 \% C.L. Our sensitivity of \$4.0{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{25\}\$ yr is competitive with the one of experiments with significantly larger isotope mass. GERDA is the first \$0{\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta\$ experiment that will be background-free up to its design exposure. This progress relies on a novel active veto system, the superior germanium detector energy resolution and the improved background recognition of our new detectors. The unique discovery potential of an essentially background-free search for \$0{\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta\$ decay motivates a larger germanium experiment with higher sensitivity.},

	abstract = {We describe a physics simulation software framework, MAGE, that is based on the GEANT4 simulation toolkit. MAGE is used to simulate the response of ultra-low radioactive background radiation detectors to ionizing radiation, specifically the MAJORANA and GERDA neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. MAJORANA and GERDA use high-purity germanium detectors to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge, and MAGE is jointly developed between these two collaborations. The MAGE framework contains the geometry models of common objects, prototypes, test stands, and the actual experiments. It also implements customized event generators, GEANT4 physics lists, and output formats. All of these features are available as class libraries that are typically compiled into a single executable. The user selects the particular experimental setup implementation at run-time via macros. The combination of all these common classes into one framework reduces duplication of efforts, eases comparison between simulated data and experiment, and simplifies the addition of new detectors to be simulated. This paper focuses on the software framework, custom event generators, and physics lists.},

No fue hasta 1898, que Marie y Pierre Curie comenzaron a estudiar el fenómeno y concluyeron que era característico de los núcleos de algunos átomos. Ese mismo año, el matrimonio Curie, descubrió dos nuevos elementos en la pechblenda, el Polonio y el Radio (objeto de este estudio), mucho más activos que el Uranio descubierto previamente.
En la naturaleza, los elementos radiactivos provienen de minerales y rocas subterráneas, que están en contacto con los acuíferos. El agua, erosiona la roca y puede disolver ciertos elementos, entre los cuales se pueden encontrar los de carácter radiactivo, cuyo contenido debe ser controlado y determinado con vistas a la potabilidad del agua.
En este trabajo, se han analizado los elementos Polonio (Po-210), autodepositado en discos de Níquel, y Radio (Ra-226), autoadsorbido en discos de MnO2, en diferentes muestras de aguas de captación profunda. Los elementos se determinaron por espectrometría alfa, característica de los mismos Las muestras analizadas se recogieron en 4 provincias de Castilla y León: Salamanca, Ávila, Valladolid y Segovia, a diferentes profundidades, y nos fueron suministradas por la Junta de Castilla y León.
Previo al análisis, ha sido necesaria la puesta a punto y el calibrado del equipo de medida, a través de un procedimiento normalizado de equipo (PNE). A continuación se desarrollaron y validaron los correspondientes Procedimientos Normalizados de Trabajo (PNT). Primero, uno en el que se desarrolló el tratamiento de disoluciones radiactivas y, posteriormente, aquellos que fueron aplicados a muestras de agua de captación profunda, obteniendo unos valores (en unidades de actividad específica mBq/Kg), que han oscilado entre 7,51 – 421,16 mBq/Kg para el Po-210, mientras que para el Ra-226 lo han hecho entre 4,75 – 584,77 mBq/Kg, y que fueron reportados a las autoridades sanitarias de la Junta de Castilla y León.},

More specifically, the following topics are discussed in detail: (i) the possible types of neutrino mass terms; (ii) oscillations of neutrinos (iii) the implications of CP invariance for the mixing and oscillations of neutrinos in vacuum; (iv) possible varieties of massive neutrinos (Dirac, Majorana, pseudo-Dirac); (v) the physical differences between massive Dirac and massive Majorana neutrinos and the possibilities of distinguishing experimentally between them; (vi) the electromagnetic properties of massive neutrinos. Some of the proposed mechanisms of neutrino mass generation in gauge theories of the electroweak interaction and in grand unified theories are also discussed. The lepton number nonconserving processes μ→eγ and μ→3e in theories with massive neutrinos are considered. The basic elements of the theory of neutrinoless double-β decay are discussed as well. Finally, the existing data on neutrino masses, oscillations of neutrinos, and neutrinoless double-β decay are briefly reviewed. The main emphasis in the review is on the general model-independent results of the theory. Detailed derivations of these are presented.},

A lower energy limit required for this interaction is found to be 9.55*10{\textasciicircum}4 GeVÂ  and it is shown that the source of such energetic neutrinos is unlikely to be from within the solar system.},

	abstract = {The GERmanium Detector Array (Gerda) at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS) searches for the neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ0{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta ) of 76{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge. Germanium detectors made of material with an enriched 76{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge fraction act simultaneously as sources and detectors for this decay. During Phase I of theexperiment mainly refurbished semi-coaxial Ge detectors from former experiments were used. For the upcoming Phase II, 30 new 76{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge enriched detectors of broad energy germanium (BEGe)-type were produced. A subgroup of these detectors has already been deployed in Gerda during Phase I. The present paper reviews the complete production chain of these BEGe detectors including isotopic enrichment, purification, crystal growth and diode production. The efforts in optimizing the mass yield and in minimizing the exposure of the 76{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge enriched germanium to cosmic radiation during processing are described. Furthermore, characterization measurements in vacuum cryostats of the first subgroup of seven BEGe detectors and their long-term behavior in liquid argon are discussed. The detector performance fulfills the requirements needed for the physics goals of Gerda Phase II.},
