	abstract = {The {DarkSide}-50 direct-detection dark matter experiment is a dual-phase argon time projection chamber operating at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This paper reports on the blind analysis and spin-independent dark matter-nucleon coupling results from a 532.4 live-days exposure, using a target of low-radioactivity argon extracted from underground sources. The background-free result in the dark matter selection box gave no evidence for dark matter. The present blind analysis sets a 90\% C.L. upper limit on the dark matter-nucleon spin-independent cross section of 1.1E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2 (3.8E-44 cm{\textasciicircum}2, 3.4E-43 cm{\textasciicircum}2) for a {WIMP} mass of 100 {GeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2 (1 {TeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2, 10 {TeV}/c{\textasciicircum}2).},

The sensitivity strongly relies on the absence of background around the Q-value of the decay. Background coming from 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K, a progeny of 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}Ar, can contribute to that background via electrons from the continuous spectrum with an endpoint at 3.5 {MeV}. Research and development on the suppression methods targeting this source of background were performed at the low-background test facility {LArGe} . It was demonstrated that by reducing 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K ion collection on the surfaces of the broad energy germanium detectors in combination with pulse shape discrimination techniques and an argon scintillation veto, it is possible to suppress 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K background by three orders of magnitude.

Designs covering many square meters with millions of signal channels are now commonplace in high-energy physics and the technology is finding its way into many other fields, ranging from astrophysics to experiments at synchrotron light sources and medical imaging. This book is the first to present a comprehensive discussion of the many facets of highly integrated semiconductor detector systems, covering sensors, signal processing, transistors and circuits, low-noise electronics, and radiation effects. The diversity of design approaches is illustrated in a chapter describing systems in high-energy physics, astronomy, and astrophysics. Finally a chapter "Why things don't work" discusses common pitfalls. Profusely illustrated, this book provides a unique reference in a key area of modern science.},

	abstract = {The Gerda collaboration is performing a sensitive search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge{\textasciicircum}\{76\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{Ge\} at the {INFN} Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy. The upgrade of the Gerda experiment from Phase I to Phase {II} has been concluded in December 2015. The first Phase {II} data release shows that the goal to suppress the background by one order of magnitude compared to Phase I has been achieved. Gerda is thus the first experiment that will remain “background-free” up to its design exposure (100 kg year{\textbackslash}hbox \{100 kg\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}hbox \{year\}). It will reach thereby a half-life sensitivity of more than 102610{\textasciicircum}\{26\} year within 3 years of data collection. This paper describes in detail the modifications and improvements of the experimental setup for Phase {II} and discusses the performance of individual detector components.},

	abstract = {We report on the first large-scale production of low radioactivity argon from underground gas wells. Low radioactivity argon is of general interest, in particular for the construction of large scale {WIMP} dark matter searches and detectors of reactor neutrinos for non-proliferation efforts. Atmospheric argon has an activity of about 1 Bq/kg from the decays of 39Ar; the concentration of 39Ar in the underground argon we are collecting is at least a factor of 100 lower than this value. The argon is collected from a stream of gas from a {CO}2 well in southwestern Colorado with a Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption ({VPSA}) plant. The gas from the well contains argon at a concentration of 400-600 ppm, and the {VPSA} plant produces an output stream with an argon concentration at the level of 30,000-50,000 ppm (3-5\%) in a single pass. This gas is sent for further processing to Fermilab where it is purified by cryogenic distillation. The argon production rate is presently 0.5 kg/day.},

	abstract = {Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in our Universe by neutrinos being their own antiparticles. This would imply the existence of neutrinoless double-β decay, which is an extremely rare lepton-number-violating radioactive decay process whose detection requires the utmost background suppression. Among the programmes that aim to detect this decay, the {GERDA} Collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double-β decay of 76Ge by operating bare detectors, made of germanium with an enriched 76Ge fraction, in liquid argon. After having completed Phase I of data taking, we have recently launched Phase {II}. Here we report that in {GERDA} Phase {II} we have achieved a background level of approximately 10−3 counts {keV}−1 kg−1 yr−1. This implies that the experiment is background-free, even when increasing the exposure up to design level. This is achieved by use of an active veto system, superior germanium detector energy resolution and improved background recognition of our new detectors. No signal of neutrinoless double-β decay was found when Phase I and Phase {II} data were combined, and we deduce a lower-limit half-life of 5.3 × 1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level. Our half-life sensitivity of 4.0 × 1025 years is competitive with the best experiments that use a substantially larger isotope mass. The potential of an essentially background-free search for neutrinoless double-β decay will facilitate a larger germanium experiment with sensitivity levels that will bring us closer to clarifying whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles.},

The signature of the signal is a monoenergetic peak at 2039 {keV}, the {QββQββQ}\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} value of the decay. To avoid bias in the signal search, the present analysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 {keV} wide region centered around {QββQββQ}\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \}. The main parameters needed for the 0νββ0νββ0{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe the observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that are expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the observation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model predicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around {QββQββQ}\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} with a background index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8 ××{\textbackslash}times 10−310−310{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} cts/({keV} kg yr). A part of the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of the background model are consistent. The observed number of events in this energy region is consistent with the background model. The background at {QββQββQ}\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} is dominated by close sources, mainly due to 4242{\textasciicircum}\{42\}K, 214214{\textasciicircum}\{214\}Bi, 228228{\textasciicircum}\{228\}Th, 6060{\textasciicircum}\{60\}Co and αα{\textbackslash}alpha emitting isotopes from the 226226{\textasciicircum}\{226\}Ra decay chain. The individual fractions depend on the assumed locations of the contaminants. It is shown, that after removal of the known γγ{\textbackslash}gamma peaks, the energy spectrum can be fitted in an energy range of 200 {keV} around {QββQββQ}\_\{{\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta \} with a constant background. This gives a background index consistent with the full model and uncertainties of the same size.},

	abstract = {High Purity Germanium detectors are used in many applications, from nuclear and astro-particle physics, to homeland security or environment protection. Although quite standard configurations are often used, with cryostats, charge sensitive amplifiers and analog or digital acquisition systems all commercially available, it might be the case that a few specific applications, e.g. satellites, portable devices, cryogenic physics experiments, etc. also require the development of a few additional or complementary techniques. An interesting case is for sure {GERDA}, the Germanium Detector Array experiment, searching for neutrino-less double beta decay of 76Ge at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of {INFN} - Italy. In {GERDA} the entire detector array, composed of semi-coaxial and {BEGe} naked crystals, is operated suspended inside a cryostat filled with liquid argon, that acts not only as cooling medium and but also as an active shield, thanks to its scintillation properties. These peculiar circumstances, together with the additional requirement of a very low radioactive background from all the materials adjacent to the detectors, clearly introduce significant constraints on the design of the Ge front-end readout electronics. All the Ge readout solutions developed within the framework of the {GERDA} collaboration, for both Phase I and Phase {II}, will be briefly reviewed, with their relative strength and weakness compared together and with respect to ideal Ge readout. Finally, the digital processing techniques developed by the {GERDA} collaboration for energy estimation of Ge detector signals will be recalled.},

Germanium detectors made of material with an enriched 7676{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge fraction act simultaneously as sources and detectors for this decay. During Phase I of theexperiment mainly refurbished semi-coaxial Ge detectors from former experiments were used. For the upcoming Phase {II}, 30 new 7676{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge enriched detectors of broad energy germanium ({BEGe})-type were produced. A subgroup of these detectors has already been deployed in Gerda during Phase I. The present paper reviews the complete production chain of these {BEGe} detectors including isotopic enrichment, purification, crystal growth and diode production. The efforts in optimizing the mass yield and in minimizing the exposure of the 7676{\textasciicircum}\{76\}Ge enriched germanium to cosmic radiation during processing are described. Furthermore, characterization measurements in vacuum cryostats of the first subgroup of seven {BEGe} detectors and their long-term behavior in liquid argon are discussed. The detector performance fulfills the requirements needed for the physics goals of Gerda Phase {II}.},

The framework is tailored to handle the full analysis flow of signals recorded by high purity Ge detectors and photo-multipliers from the veto counters. It is designed to support a multi-channel modular and flexible analysis, widely customizable by the user either via human-readable initialization files or via a graphical interface. The framework organizes the data into a multi-level structure, from the raw data up to the condensed analysis parameters, and includes tools and utilities to handle the data stream between the different levels. {GELATIO} is implemented in C++. It relies upon {ROOT} and its extension {TAM}, which provides compatibility with {PROOF}, enabling the software to run in parallel on clusters of computers or many-core machines. It was tested on different platforms and benchmarked in several {GERDA}-related applications. A stable version is presently available for the {GERDA} Collaboration and it is used to provide the reference analysis of the experiment data.},
